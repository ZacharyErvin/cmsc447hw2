I used flask and sqlalchemy to create this website and database

To run it:
make sure pip and flask are downloaded
Download the folder labelled "myproject"
run the file "main.py" this is inside of "myproject" and the website will be started (should be http://127.0.0.1:5000 )


Some extra notes:
the database is stored in the instance folder.
I was unsure if we should allow duplicate entries so I allowed them incase someone had multiple point values.
everything is case sensitive, so if you add a user "bob jones " you must include the space at the end to interact with them for search and remove.
